                            With a course that offers a postgraduate certificate in education (PGCE) with qualified teacher status (QTS), you’ll be able to teach in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This qualification is also recognised internationally. Many PGCE courses include credits that count towards a Master’s degree.

                            Qualified teacher status (QTS) allows you to teach in state schools in England.

                            If you want to teach in the rest of the UK or internationally, then you’ll need to do a course that offers ‘postgraduate certification in education with qualified teacher status’ instead.
