        <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
          <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
          <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
          <li>listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the text on the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>
